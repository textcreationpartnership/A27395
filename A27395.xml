            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THis Teſtimony lives in my Heart, and is upon me to bear for and concerning my dear and well beloved Friend <hi>William Bennit,</hi> whom, with many more worthy Ones, God Almighty, in his endleſs Love unto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, raiſed up and endued with power from on high, to preach the Everlaſting Goſpel of Life and Salvation in our Age; and forever bleſſed be the Lord who hath cauſed his bleſſed Work to proſper by them, to the gathering many Thouſands to himſelf, notwithſtanding the great oppoſition they have meet with, both from the Enemy of mankind within, and the Exerciſes, Hardſhips and cruel Perſecutions from his Inſtruments without; yet ſo powerfully did the Lord appear in them, that the Inhabitants of the Earth was awakened, and Trembling took hold of many, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was laid to the Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56763:5"/> yea, the ſound of the Goſpel, by theſe worthy Meſſengers Preached, went through the Earth, and many of its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance thereby came to learn Righteouſneſs; amongſt which worthy Meſſengers this my dear Friend <hi>William Bennit</hi> was one, who laboured in the ſervice of the Goſpel for the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the out-caſts of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the diſperced of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was a man wholly given up both in Body and Mind to ſerve the Lord, and what he did for God, he did it with all his Might; he ſpared no pains wherein he might ſerve the Truth, which to do was his whole delight, his care was great over the Church of Chriſt and whole Family of God, and when in Bonds for the Goſpel ſake, he viſited them with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers good Epiſtle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I believe years to come will know the want of him.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56763:5"/> there appeared no Infirmneſs of Body in him, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the weakneſs of his Body, he often Travelled in the ſervice of the Goſpel, being freely given up to ſpend, and to be ſpent for its ſake; his Miniſtry was plain &amp; prevalent, vvhereof he had a very good Gift, he vvas vvell acquainted vvith the holy Scriptures of Truth, vvhich he made much uſe of for the opening the Underſtandings of People, vvhich often proved very Effectual for the convincing of many.</p>

                  <p>And by the Principle of Love in our hearts, are our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences made very tender to God-ward, inſomuch as that we would not willingly and knowingly ſin againſt him, and are willing rather to ſuffer the loſs of all External things, yea even Life and all, then to break our peace with God, which we value more then ten thouſand Worlds; and becauſe we endeavour (in the ſtrength and power of the principle of love in our hearts) to keep our Conſciences void of offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; and becauſe we dare not do thoſe things (though they be ſet up by men, and tollerated and compelled to be done by a Law) which we are perſwaded by the unerring ſpirit of Truth we ought not to do, neither joyn with any therein; and becauſe we dare not forbear doing thoſe things (though prohibited by the Laws of men there from) which we are perſwaded by the ſpirit of Truth is our duty (towards God) to do and perform; therefore are we a ſuffering People
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56763:48"/> this day, and for no other Cauſe, the Lord is our witneſs to the truth hereof.</p>
                  <p>And ever ſince the Lord our dear and tender God (who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone hath been, and now is our Helper, Strength and Refuge, and hath ſtood by us, and ſupported, and preſerved us, or elſe we had not been a People at this day) did raiſe us up to be a People, for to bear witneſs to his Way and Truth (and againſt the falſe Ways, evil Works, falſe Worſhips, Idolatry, Sin and Wickedneſs of the World) we have been a ſuffering People, and all along we have ſuffered by every Power that hath come up to Rule, and all along we have ſuffered for only our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences towards God; &amp; if our Enemies have had no Law in force againſt us, neither could find any thing on our parts, whereby they might take a juſt occaſion againſt us; then have they (as <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Perſecutors did againſt him, who ſought his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction without a Cauſe given them by him) even made Laws on purpoſe to Inſnare us, and Trappan us concerning our Conſcience towards God, for which we did ſuffer by the other Rulers, even many ways, <hi>viz.</hi> by Stocking, Stoning, cruel Whipping, Rayling, Reviling and cruel Abuſes; even Impriſonment until Death, and ſpoyling of Goods in a more abundant manner then I can relate; and all hath been for our Conſciences to God, all which we have born, and waded through in Patience, through the ſtrength of the upholding merciful Arm of our God, and by him have been kept from ſeeking Revenge upon our Enemies, but have committed our Cauſe to God, who Judgeth Righteouſly, and Juſtifieth thoſe whom men Condemn, unto whom alone Vengence belongs, and he will repay it, who will render unto man according to his Works.</p>
                  <p>And even at this day, our Sufferings are greater then before, and now are we even as Sheep appointed for the Slaughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all is becauſe we endeavour to keep our Conſciences void of

                  <p>VVHen I was but young in Years, the Lord God (of Light, Life and Power, of tender Love, of infinite Compaſſion and everlaſting bowels of Mercy) was pleaſed then (in ſome meaſure) to viſit me by or with his pure Light in my own Conſcience, which many a

And in thoſe days when I was alone in the Fields I cryed and prayed unto the Lord, and deſires were ſtirring in me after the knowledge of him, his Way and Truth; but I prayed to a God I knew not; I imagined a God afar off; and did not then know it was the Lord that did
